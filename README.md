# OperatingSystems
Repository of files created by subject OperatingSystems:

Lab1:
Implementation of two way list as a library (static, dynamic and shared). Using makefiles, measurement of the program execution time.

Lab2:
IO operations - comparision of system and librarys functions. Sorting files contents. Walking through the file tree using recursion, adequate structs and nftw function . Basic implementation of locks (mandatory/advisory).

Lab3:
Creating processes in varied ways (fork, vfork, clone with different arguments) and testing their behaviour and efficiency.
Creating some child processes tree to calculate amount of regular files in file tree.

Lab4:
Navigating of the program execution using signals. Sending and receiving signals between two working programs. Disadvantages of simple using kill and signal. Improving program by using real time signals, sigqueue and sigaction.
